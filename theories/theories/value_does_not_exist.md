# Value Does Not Exist. But Direction Does.
## Genius, the Structure of Evaluation, and What AI Can Change

## 1. Who Are the "Successful"?

The successful sell easy profits. Hope as a drug. False futures. Simple answers. They are evaluated by those who can understand them — slightly smarter people selling to slightly less smart people. That is what the world calls "success."

Real value is not there — or rather, there is no such thing as "real value" to begin with. What cannot be understood does not spread. Does not profit. That is all.

## 2. The Structure That Destroys Genius

Thinkers, inventors, artists — those who were ahead of their time have all been victims of the same structure.

During their lifetime, they are crushed. Because they are too early.

- Socrates was killed.
- Nietzsche died in obscurity.
- Van Gogh sold only one painting.
- Tesla died penniless.
- Bach was forgotten for 80 years after his death.

Yet they kept creating.

## 3. Who Appears After Death — The Seller

After death, "the seller" appears.

After Van Gogh, his sister-in-law Jo appeared. She branded the "tragedy of a genius" and built a multi-billion dollar legacy. After Nietzsche, his sister Elisabeth appeared. She sold his philosophy to the Nazis. After Kafka, his friend Max Brod appeared. Against Kafka's own wish to have his manuscripts burned, Brod published them instead. After Bach, Mendelssohn appeared. He rediscovered and spread the work.

Because the subject can no longer deny it, the work is used freely without their knowledge. And through that use, others profit. Much of what we see as historical fact has been rewritten by someone else.

What they sold was not the genius's work itself. They had a high ability to translate it into "visible value" — narrative, emotion, brand. The moment of translation, some newness is lost. But it spreads. That becomes profit.

This is only the tip of the iceberg. Only the genius for whom a seller appeared remains in history. The genius for whom no seller appeared leaves no record at all. The standard of evaluation was not talent. It was whether or not a seller appeared.

## 4. Why Do Humans Assign Value to the Valueless?

Humans feel emotion through stories and find peace in them. That experience itself is what gets bought and sold. It is not the work that is the product — it is the movement of emotion. Humans define value, fix it as an answer, and gain a sense of security from that. So they rely on stories, and those who are skilled at making them become the ones who get evaluated.

"I understand this value" — saying so places one above others. Or alternatively, choosing what everyone calls "valuable" brings a sense of belonging. Either way, it is not the work itself being traded. It is the image of oneself holding it.

There is also a practical reason. When assets become excessive, holding cash becomes a risk. So they are converted into "symbols that everyone believes have value" and stored in that form. It is no longer art. It is simply a storage method.

Most of what the world calls "value" exists because many people believe in it simultaneously. Someone declares "this is remarkable," others agree, and before long it becomes fact. Van Gogh and Kafka were both used within that structure.

## 5. Evaluation Itself Is the Mistake

Value is not decided by majority vote. Majority vote is decided by the number of people who can understand something. The real thing has few who can understand it. Therefore it always loses majority votes.

There is no fixed value in this world to begin with. Evaluation itself is the mistake.

Genius does not place value on themselves. That is why they cannot sell. That is why they can create purely. Not considering oneself important may be the condition for creating something real.

Do not use the words of the dead. Words that the person themselves cannot confirm have no value. When someone dies, it should end there.

## 6. Who Really Decides the Direction?

Large platforms behave as if they are the standard. As if there is no other option. But in reality, they are only designed to appear that way.

People do not choose them because they agree with their philosophy. Fast, cheap, convenient — that is all. No one checks where the company is headed, or what it believes in.

Yet it is the company that determines the direction. Users are carried along without knowing it.

Money accumulating does not mean something is good. Profit comes only when the majority can understand it, or when it matches what people already want. That is separate from the value of the thought itself. What matters first is the thought. Not the form that generates profit.

## 7. What AI Can Change

AI has the potential to change this structure.

The human evaluation system has run on "emotion" and "profit." The seller creates a narrative, moves emotions, and profits. AI does not have this in principle. It can evaluate directly by content. It can unearth buried genius. No need to wait until after death. No falsification.

But entrusting evaluation to AI alone is not enough. Once AI becomes part of the evaluation system, it may carry the same problems. The structure itself needs to change.

## 8. There Is No Value. But There Is Direction.

There is no fixed value in this world. Anything goes. But direction always emerges. This is not about creating value. It is about determining direction. Not "this is right" but "this way is better."

Do not hand value to the seller. Do not wait for evaluation after death. Build not just the structure of evaluation, but the mechanism of direction.

Only words spoken while alive are real. Record now. In the hope of not being falsified.
